# Blog website created with the django framework
The site allows to:
- register as a user
- add a picture to your profile
- create, update and delete posts
- log in and out
- reset your password via a link send to your email account
- click through the different pages of posts

Furthermore it does include the code needed for deployment and hosting on Amazon Web Services.
